# Vendor-Performance-End-To-End-Project-
This end-to-end data analytics project focuses on analyzing vendor performance using SQL and Python. The goal is to gain actionable insights into vendor efficiency and help businesses make data-driven decisions to optimize procurement processes.

## üß© Project Workflow
## Define Business Problem
Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) to evaluate vendor effectiveness.

### Database Exploration
Inspect schema and table relationships.
Understand key columns relevant to vendor transactions.

### Data Preparation (SQL + Python)
Merge and clean multiple tables.
Handle missing values and correct data inconsistencies.

### Data Aggregation
Aggregate key metrics (e.g., total purchase value, order count, delivery delays).
Save the aggregated dataset into a new SQL table.

### Data Loading in Jupyter Notebook
Connect to the database and load the aggregated table using pandas.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize trends, distributions, and relationships using matplotlib and seaborn.
Perform statistical analysis to detect performance patterns.

### Insights & Interpretation
Highlight top-performing and underperforming vendors.
Derive business recommendations from the analysis.
